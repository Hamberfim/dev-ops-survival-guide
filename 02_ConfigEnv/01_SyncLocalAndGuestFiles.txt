# Synchronize local and guest files
# By default, Vagrant shares your project directory 
# (the one containing the Vagrantfile) to the 
# /vagrant directory in your guest machine.

# After having created and configured a guest machine 
# via your Vagrantfile bring up the VM

01 Bring up your VM
    terminal:
        $ vagrant up

02 Access the VM via ssh
    terminal:
        $ vagrant ssh

03 Explore the sync folder
    # When you vagrant ssh into your machine,
    # you're in /home/vagrant, 
    # which is a different directory from the 
    # synced /vagrant directory.
    terminal:
        # the Vagrantfile that you see inside the virtual machine 
        # is the same Vagrantfile that is on your actual host machine.
        $ ls /vagrant

04 Test the sync folder
    terminal:
        # create a sub-directory
        $ touch /vagrant/foo

        # exit ssh session
        $ exit

        # list the contents of the local vagrant directory and
        # see that the new directory you created on your VM 
        # is reflected there
