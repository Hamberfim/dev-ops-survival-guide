# Suspend the machine
# Suspending the virtual machine will stop it and 
# save its current running state.
     terminal:
        $ vagrant suspend

        # bring the machine back up and 
        # its state resumes from where you left off.
        $ vagrant up

# Halt the machine
# Halting will gracefully shut down the guest operating system 
# and power down the guest machine
    terminal:
        # Halting cleanly shuts it down, preserving the contents of disk
        $ vagrant halt

        # bring the machine back up and 
        $ vagrant up
