# Synchronize local and guest files
# By default, Vagrant shares your project directory 
# (the one containing the Vagrantfile) to the 
# /vagrant directory in your guest machine.

# After having created and configured a guest machine 
# via your Vagrantfile bring up the VM

01 Bring up your VM
    terminal:
        $ vagrant up

02 Access the VM via ssh
    terminal:
        $ vagrant ssh

03 Explore the sync folder
    # When you vagrant ssh into your machine,
    # you're in /home/vagrant, 
    # which is a different directory from the 
    # synced /vagrant directory.
    terminal:
        # the Vagrantfile that you see inside the virtual machine 
        # is the same Vagrantfile that is on your actual host machine.
        $ ls /vagrant

04 Test the sync folder
    terminal:
        # create a sub-directory
        $ touch /vagrant/foo

        # exit ssh session
        $ exit

        # list the contents of the local vagrant directory and
        # see that the new directory you created on your VM 
        # is reflected there

# Teardown options beyond destroy and remove

# Suspend the machine
# Suspending the virtual machine will stop it and 
# save its current running state.
     terminal:
        $ vagrant suspend

        # bring the machine back up and 
        # its state resumes from where you left off.
        $ vagrant up

# Halt the machine
# Halting will gracefully shut down the guest operating system 
# and power down the guest machine
    terminal:
        # Halting cleanly shuts it down, preserving the contents of disk
        $ vagrant halt

        # bring the machine back up and 
        $ vagrant up
